# Accident-Detection-system-From-Image-Using-Machine-Learning
This involves creating an image classification system (web application) for accident detection from an image using the Learning machine. 


## Dataset

Our models were built based on balanced dataset that is a set of images with extension [.jpg].Our dataset is a folder with two sub-folders with “No Accident” and “Accident” labels:
- Folder 1 includes 800 images with the No Accident label.
- - Folder 2 includes 801 images with the Accident label.
The purpose of this dataset is to detect accidents, by image processing
